# Bank Customer Churn Analysis - SQL Project

## Project Overview
The Bank Customer Churn Analysis project is focused on understanding customer behavior and identifying factors that influence customer churn in a bank. The goal is to build a model to predict whether a customer is likely to leave the bank (churn) based on key attributes such as credit score, tenure, account balance, number of products held, and other relevant factors.

## Key Objectives:
* **Analyze Customer Data**: Perform SQL-based exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key trends and patterns in customer behavior.
* **Churn Prediction**: Perform different types of SQL queries to predict customer churn based on historical data.
* **Insights Generation**: Provide actionable insights to help the bank retain valuable customers and improve customer satisfaction.
